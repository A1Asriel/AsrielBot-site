# AsrielBot Legacy Privacy Policy

This document ("Privacy Policy") only applies to the instance of AsrielBot Legacy hosted by the bot account `AsrielBot Legacy#0271` ("Bot"). The use of the Bot in a server (guild) requires the processing and/or storing of some specific user data ("Data").

## Processing of Data:
Bot starts processing the guild ID as soon as it is invited to a server. It can be shown in the developer console, which is cleared every time the Bot is being turned off.
The Bot might log IDs of the users who typed any valid commands into any channel, accessible by the Bot, sent a direct message to the Bot, or explicitly mentioned the Bot in any channel.
The Bot processes the messages content and attachments in the relayed channels to forward them, but does not store them.
The Bot processes and/or caches almost all the accessible Data including but not limited to: message IDs, message content, message attachments, member IDs, member usernames, member server nicknames, member avatar URLs, member custom statuses with the purpose of operating properly, although it cannot be accessed by the developer directly.

## Storing of Data:
The Bot does not store any user Data until the person managing the mentioned account grants permission to do so for reasons including but not limited to: providing a custom status response, attribution for help in developing/translating the Bot.
After a member with the permission to Manage Server accepts the terms of Privacy Policy, the Bot writes the guild ID into the local database to store the server configuration. It also stores preferences including but not limited to: prefix, language, whether to respond to triggers, a channel ID for sending the message edits and deletions on the server.

## Access to Data:
The mentioned Data is stored on a personal computer of the Bot developer. Only they are able to access and/or modify the Data at any given time.

## Removal of Data:
The Bot is able to delete the server preferences alongside with its ID from the database by using the option "Leave and forget", provided by using the command `a!leave`.
In case if you want to remove all your user information (considering you gave your permission to store it before), you can request the removal manually by contacting the Bot developer in the direct messages or in the support server.

> The developer reserves the right to modify this document at any given time, with or without noticing the users.
