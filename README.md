# AsrielBot Legacy

AsrielBot Legacy is a friendly Discord bot, powered by our own Anastellos Engine, which is mainly designed to solve ambiguity during the role-playing process. Although, it also can be used as a general purpose bot as it provides powerful moderation tools, custom responses, AFK statuses, etc.

Currently, it is in beta development stage, so there will be more features and improvements over time!  
*It is planned to open the source code before we get to the full release.*

## Quick start

1. Invite the bot using the link above. It already has the recommended permissions enabled for the proper operation.
2. Send `a!help` to see the list of all available commands.

## Features

### Role-playing commands

The bot can help players and game masters to decide whether a certain action was successful or not. *Try* it yourself by using `a!try` or `a!try3` command to determine if your character succeed in lifting up that heavy branch!

Normally, it is hard to trace the movements of characters in complex and huge RP servers. They go back and forth, from location to location... But the `a!travel` command brings the players an easy and convenient way to mark that their characters were relocated to another channel, and the spectators will be able to follow them in a single click.

### Messages relaying

AsrielBot Legacy provides you an easy way to connect two of your channels as seamlessly as it can get! And it doesn't matter if these channels are in the different servers, as long as the bot is present in both of them, this feature is available for you.

### Moderation

With this bot, you can set up a log channel which will trace every deleted or edited message, as well as mass deletion by other bots *(it won't recover the contents, unfortunately)*. Speaking of which, AsrielBot Legacy provides you a more convenient way of purging channels by simply marking the upper and lower messages, and it will delete every message in between. No more accidental deletion of extra messages by messing up with the numbers!

### User statuses

Every member of a server can mark themselves as AFK, busy or even sleeping without typing any commands! You just have to put `[afk]`/`[away]`, `[busy]`/`[dnd]` or `[sleep]` into your status (it doesn't matter where exactly you are putting it). After that, every person who tries to ping you gets notified about your current unavailability.

### Multilingual

The bot can speak English, Russian and German (maintained by Zero, slightly outdated as of August 18th, 2022). The admins should use `a!settings lang <language code>` to change it.  
We are open for the new contributors who are willing to bring their language into our project!

## Powered by [Anastellos Engine](https://github.com/A1Asriel/anastellos)

Formerly the AsrielBot's soul, now is used as a modular universal Discord bot engine. It provides easy methods to manage the internals of any bot, as well as some predefined basic commands.

## FAQ

### Why "Legacy"?

The development cycle of the bot was started way before its author got any decent programming skills, so the code is plagued by internal inconsistencies and hardcoding, and poorly designed. It was decided to make an entirely new bot using a brand new engine, but it's not an easy task. That project's development is frozen, but not discontinued. While we're trying to make ourselves work on that completely redesigned solution, we will keep supporting this version as well.

### Why is the bot offline most of the time?

Currently, it's hosted on the developer's PC, so it has to be shut down sometimes (mostly during nighttime). We wish we could afford an independent host, but it just isn't worth it yet.
